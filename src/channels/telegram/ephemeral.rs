//! Ephemeral group replies: Bot API 10.2 (`receiver_user_id`), 2026-07-14.
//!
//! Telegram can deliver a group message to a single member: nobody else in
//! the chat ever sees it. Every OpenCrabs slash command is owner-gated, so
//! today the whole group watches replies addressed to one person. Scoping
//! those to the invoker keeps the group context and drops the noise (#756).
//!
//! teloxide 0.17 / teloxide-core 0.13 has no binding for the parameter, so
//! this calls `sendMessage` directly over HTTP, mirroring [`super::rich::api`].
//! Whether `sendRichMessage` also accepts the parameter is settled at runtime
//! rather than assumed: see [`try_send_rich`]. Scoped replies fall back to
//! HTML only once the server has actually refused the rich variant.
//!
//! Nothing here returns an error. A send that does not land reports how much
//! was delivered and the caller finishes the job on its normal public path,
//! which is exactly the pre-10.2 behaviour. That covers both a Bot API server
//! older than 10.2 and a future rename of the parameter.
