//! Newest-first ordering for the model picker (#1057).
//!
//! The picker rendered `config.models` in array order, and whatever registers
//! a newly discovered model appends it, so every new release landed at the
//! bottom of the list — the one entry the user is most likely reaching for,
//! in the position hardest to find.
//!
//! Plain alphabetical does not fix it. Ascending lexicographic order puts
//! `glm-5.3s` after `glm-4.5` anyway, reproducing the complaint, and it breaks
//! outright across a version boundary: `glm-5.10` sorts before `glm-5.2` as
//! text while being the newer model. Version segments have to compare as
//! numbers.
//!
//! So ordering is "natural" (digit runs compared numerically, everything else
//! lexicographically) and descending, which puts the highest version first
//! regardless of how many digits it has.

/// One run of a model id: a number or the text between numbers.
