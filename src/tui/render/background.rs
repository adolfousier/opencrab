//! Footer indicator for detached background commands (#762).
//!
//! A genuinely long command (`cargo test`, a build) runs detached so it does
//! not churn toward the bash 600s cap, and the turn ends immediately. That
//! left the TUI with nothing to draw: the agent says it is waiting, the
//! spinner is gone because no turn is active, and a five-minute build is
//! indistinguishable from a hang.
//!
//! Pure formatting, so the shape is testable without a terminal or a live
//! task. Elapsed seconds are passed in rather than read from a clock here.

/// How much of a command label the indicator shows.
///
/// The stored label allows 60 characters, which is fine for a log line and far
/// too long for a border title: a full `cargo test --locked --profile ci --lib
/// 2>&1 | tail -40` crowded out everything beside it. The leading words are
/// what identify the command, so the tail is what gets dropped.
pub(crate) const LABEL_CHARS: usize = 28;

/// `cargo test 32s`, or `cargo test 32s +2` when other tasks are also running.
///
/// The oldest task is the one named: it is the one the user has been waiting
/// on longest, and it is the one whose elapsed time answers "is this stuck".
/// `None` when nothing is running, so the caller omits the field entirely
/// rather than showing an empty slot.
///
/// `max_label` truncates the command, never the elapsed time or the overflow
/// count: those are short, fixed-width, and the whole point of the indicator.
