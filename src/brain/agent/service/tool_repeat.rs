//! Consecutive identical tool-call detection (#1030).
//!
//! Repeating a call with identical arguments returns an identical result, so
//! it is never productive. Left unnoticed it runs until the PROVIDER objects:
//! DashScope-style backends reject the whole conversation with a 500
//! `Repetitive tool calls detected`, after which the history is poisoned and
//! every subsequent request fails the same way. [`super::repetition`] recovers
//! from that state; this notices first, which is cheaper.
//!
//! **This never ends a turn.** OpenCrabs nudges and retries, and once the
//! retry budget is spent it walks the fallback chain. This adds one more
//! signal to that ladder and changes nothing about it. The reference
//! implementation (qwen-code's `loopDetectionService`) halts the turn instead;
//! that remedy is deliberately not copied, only the detection.
//!
//! Nor does it suppress a call. The repeated call still executes and its
//! result still reaches the model; the nudge is appended alongside. Skipping
//! the call would silently change what the agent did, and a detector is not
//! entitled to that.
