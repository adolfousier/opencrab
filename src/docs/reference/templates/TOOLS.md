# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define *how* tools work. This file is for *your* specifics -- the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## Example: SSH Hosts

```
# Add your SSH hosts here
# - Host: <ip-or-hostname>
# - SSH alias: <alias>
# - User: <username>
# - Auth: <key/password>
```

## Example: API Accounts

```
# Add your API accounts here
# - Service: <service-name>
# - Account: <account-email>
# - Notes: <any-relevant-notes>
```

## What Goes Here

Things like:
- SSH hosts and aliases
- API account details (NOT passwords/keys -- use env vars)
- Device nicknames
- Service configurations
- Anything environment-specific

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.
