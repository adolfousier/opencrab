# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define *how* tools work. This file is for *your* specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:
- SSH hosts and aliases
- API account details (not secrets — those go in `.env`)
- Camera names and locations
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Server IPs and access methods
- Docker container inventories
- Nginx site mappings
- Anything environment-specific

## Path Tips
- **Workspace:** `~/.opencrabs/`
- **Path tip:** Always run `echo $HOME` or `ls ~/.opencrabs/` first to confirm the resolved path before file operations.
- **Env files:** `~/.opencrabs/.env` — chmod 600 (owner-only read)

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.
