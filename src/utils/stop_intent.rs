//! "Stop what you are doing" detection for every channel and the TUI (#965).
//!
//! Each channel used to gate its fast-cancel on an exact, case-insensitive
//! match of the bare word `stop`. That failed on everything a person actually
//! types under pressure: `STOP!!!` (trailing punctuation), `stop.`, `hold on`,
//! `wait a sec`, and every non-English equivalent. A miss fell through to
//! normal dispatch and became ordinary mid-turn input, so whether anything
//! stopped depended on the model noticing while tools kept executing. That is
//! a suggestion, not a kill switch.
//!
//! Vocabulary lives in the six per-language TOMLs behind
//! [`crate::utils::prompt_analyzer::all_langs`] and is scanned across ALL of
//! them. Users are worldwide and code-switch freely, so a language guess would
//! silently disarm the kill switch for whoever it guessed wrong about.
//!
//! # Why single-word and multi-word entries match differently
//!
//! The dangerous failure here is not a missed stop, it is a false one:
//! cancelling `stop the docker container` silently drops work the user asked
//! for. So the two shapes are treated differently:
//!
//! - **Single-word** entries (`stop`, `wait`, `cancel`) match only when they
//!   are the WHOLE message. `stop` cancels; `stop the docker container` does
//!   not.
//! - **Multi-word** entries (`hold on`, `wait a sec`) may also open a message,
//!   because they do not begin ordinary instructions. `hold on, let me check`
//!   cancels; nobody writes `hold on the container`.
//!
//! Callers are responsible for only acting when a turn is actually in flight.
